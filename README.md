# üß† Loan Status Predictor

This project builds and compares machine learning models to predict the **loan repayment status** (Fully Paid or Charged Off) using a Lending Club dataset. It is developed as part of the **CPSC 3750: Artificial Intelligence** course.

---

## üîç Project Overview

- **Problem**: Predict whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off using applicant and loan details.
- **AI Topics**: Supervised learning, class imbalance handling (SMOTE), model evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Goal**: Build a reliable, interpretable, and optimized loan classification system.

## üì¶ Dataset

- Source: Lending Club loan dataset (2.2M+ rows)
- Filtered only loans with: `Fully Paid` or `Charged Off` statuses
- Cleaned and encoded key features including: `term`, `grade`, `home_ownership`, `purpose`, etc.
- Downsampled to 5000 rows for fast development/testing

### üîß Preprocessing steps:
- Dropped irrelevant and high-cardinality columns
- Cleaned `emp_length` values
- Label encoded categorical features
- Handled missing values with `fillna(0)`
- Applied **SMOTE** to handle class imbalance

## ü§ñ Models Used

1. **Random Forest** ‚úÖ Best performer
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Gradient Boosting**

All models are trained using the same data split and evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall / F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

---

## üß™ Sample Output (Random Forest)

```
accuracy: 1.00
precision: 1.00
recall: 1.00
f1-score: 1.00
```

> *Note: These metrics are based on the 5,000-row sample dataset with SMOTE applied.*

## üë• Team Member Guide

### If you're a team member:
- Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
- Clone the project and install requirements
- Review the notebook or .py file for logic and edits
- Do **not commit the CSV dataset**
- Contribute to documentation and improvement ideas in `README.md` or `report.md`

## üîÆ Future Work Suggestions

- Add feature importance visualizations and SHAP explainability
- Deploy as a web app (Streamlit or Flask)
- Incorporate more advanced models (XGBoost, CatBoost)
- Evaluate with ROC-AUC, PR-AUC
- Add error analysis and fairness audit
- Run hyperparameter optimization (e.g., Optuna)
